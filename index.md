**Making advanced automation practical for Swedish industry.**

Automation is becoming unavoidable — but for many companies it is still too complex, too risky, or too fragmented to adopt at scale.  
At the same time, global competitors are accelerating rapidly by combining robotics, AI, and digital production systems in ways that reshape entire value chains.

**Automate Sweden exists to close this gap.**  
We connect industry, researchers, integrators, and technology providers to turn advanced automation from isolated pilots into scalable, deployable solutions for Swedish industry.

## What Automate Sweden is

Automate Sweden is a **national, federated ecosystem for industrial automation** — and a **platform that provides shared infrastructure, coordination, and continuity**.

We are built to **close the loop between all key stakeholders** involved in automation: industry, researchers, system integrators, technology providers, and public actors.  
Instead of fragmented initiatives or one-off pilots, Automate Sweden connects needs, knowledge, infrastructure, and deployment into a continuous system.

Our focus is not automation as a standalone technology, but **automation as a shared industrial capability** — developed collaboratively and made deployable across sectors, regions, and company sizes.

## Who Automate Sweden is for

### For SMEs
**You need practical automation that reduces risk and effort.**  
Automate Sweden helps SMEs move from idea to implementation through shared test environments, validated solutions, and ecosystem support.

### For large enterprises
**You need strategic automation capabilities and stronger value chains.**  
Automate Sweden offers a coordinated way to engage with emerging automation methods, shape focus areas, and strengthen suppliers and integrators.

### For system integrators and technology providers
**You need validation, scaling pathways, and real industrial contexts.**  
Automate Sweden connects technology to real use cases, pilots, and testbeds — supporting the path from prototype to deployable offerings.

### For researchers and public-sector actors
**You need impact pathways from research to deployment.**  
Automate Sweden provides long-term platforms where excellent research connects directly to industrial needs, validation, and adoption.

## How Automate Sweden works  
**A platform that enables an ecosystem — and an ecosystem that feeds the platform**

At the core of Automate Sweden is a continuous loop:

**Industrial needs** → shape **research and pilots** → validated in **testbeds** → translated by **integrators/providers** → deployed in **industry** → producing **feedback** that informs the next cycle.

This loop replaces fragmented pilots with a **repeatable pathway from idea to industrial impact**.

As a **platform**, Automate Sweden provides shared structure and continuity:
- shared test and demonstration environments  
- coordinated pilot and validation activities  
- common practices and scalable approaches  
- long-term continuity beyond individual projects

As a **federated ecosystem**, Automate Sweden enables collaboration without centralisation:
participants remain independent, but work together through shared purpose and shared infrastructure.

## Why now

Industrial automation is entering a new phase. Advances in robotics, AI, and digital production systems are accelerating — while regulation, demographic pressure, and global competition raise the stakes.

For Sweden, this creates a narrow window of opportunity:
- to turn strong research and industrial know-how into deployable systems  
- to ensure SMEs are not left behind in the next automation wave  
- to strengthen value chains, not just individual firms  
- to shape how advanced automation is developed, deployed, and governed  

Automate Sweden is a response to this moment.

## Shaping the cluster together

Automate Sweden is being built for the long term — but not behind closed doors.

While the core mission and structure are clear, the cluster is **intentionally under development**. The concrete focus areas, testbeds, modes of collaboration, and priorities will be shaped together with the organisations that engage.

This is a deliberate choice: advanced automation cannot be designed top-down. It must reflect real industrial needs, constraints, and opportunities — across company sizes and sectors.

## Ways to engage

### Engage now: shaping the cluster
Right now, engagement happens through **direct discussions and workshops**.  
This phase is about co-design: identifying priorities, defining meaningful use cases, and shaping how the cluster should work in practice.

👉 **Get in touch to start a conversation or join upcoming workshops.**  
(See the “Get involved” page for details.)

### Engage next: participating in the cluster
Once Automate Sweden is formally established, additional engagement pathways will open, such as structured pilot activities, shared testbeds, and long-term collaboration formats — designed based on the insights gathered in the current development phase.
