                <h2>Purpose</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Automate Sweden will build a world-leading cluster of excellence in robotics that strengthens Sweden's long-term competitiveness through faster automation in SMEs. We treat robots as autonomous systems with AI that makes robots adapt to humans, which lowers programming costs, increases flexibility, and shortens the time from idea to operation. Phase 1 focuses on manufacturing: lab automation, machine operation and picking/kitting.</p>

            <h2>Our approach</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The cluster brings together six universities (LTH, KTH, LiU, &Ouml;rebro, Chalmers, UU), IUC/SWIRA, RISE, and leading companies (ABB, Tetra Pak, AstraZeneca and others). We are establishing a federated "Automate Sweden Campus" with RISE as host, a common "single front door", common test beds, and a booking portal. International partners (e.g. MIRMI/TUM, DLR, KIT, DTI/Fraunhofer IPA) provide peer review and pace.</p>

                <h2>Expected effects and result</h2>
            </header>
            <p>More and faster SME installations, lower conversion costs, better energy and resource efficiency and a broadened skills base. In the long term, the cluster will become financially self-sustaining and make Sweden Europe's reference for AI-driven SME automation.</p>
