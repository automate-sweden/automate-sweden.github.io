Automate Sweden is a **national, federated ecosystem for industrial automation** — and a **platform that provides shared infrastructure, coordination, and continuity**.

Our purpose is to **close the loop** between all stakeholders needed to turn advanced automation into real industrial capability:
industry (SMEs and large enterprises), researchers, system integrators, technology providers, and public actors.

Instead of fragmented initiatives and one-off pilots, Automate Sweden is designed to connect needs, validation, deployment, and learning into a continuous system.

## What we are building

Automate Sweden is intentionally being developed step by step.  
The mission and operating logic are clear, while concrete priorities (focus areas, testbeds, collaboration formats) are **co-designed together with the organisations that engage**.

This is a deliberate choice: advanced automation cannot be designed top-down. It must reflect real constraints and opportunities across sectors and company sizes.

## What “closing the loop” means in practice

Automation succeeds when it becomes repeatable:

**needs** → **research & pilots** → **validation in testbeds** → **integration into deployable solutions** → **deployment in industry** → **feedback that improves the next cycle**

Automate Sweden creates the conditions for this loop to run continuously — at national scale.

## What we focus on

We treat robots and automation as **autonomous systems**, where AI helps systems adapt to people and processes, lowering programming cost, increasing flexibility, and reducing time from idea to deployment.

Our ambition is practical impact:
- faster and safer adoption of automation in SMEs  
- stronger industrial value chains and integration capacity  
- shared test and demonstration environments  
- a clearer pathway from excellent research to deployed systems

## Ways to engage

Engagement happens in two phases:

- **Engage now:** discussions and workshops to shape the cluster  
- **Engage next:** structured participation once the cluster is established (pilots, testbeds, collaboration formats)
