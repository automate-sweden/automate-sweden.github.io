                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Sweden's large manufacturing companies are entering a new industrial reality. In China, most of the world’s new robot capacity is now being installed, supported by massive state investments in AI and with a clear strategy for humanoid robotics in industry. At the same time, Swedish enterprises face rising costs, skills shortages and intensifying global competition, making time-to-scale and risk reduction decisive factors for the next wave of automation.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>As a national platform, Automate Sweden will take on a central role in developing Sweden’s robotics capability over the next 10-15 years, with a clear link to security of supply, technological sovereignty and long-term industrial sustainability. For companies that engage early, a unique opportunity opens up: to influence how tomorrow's production systems are shaped, and secure their place in the next industrial era.</p>

            <h2>Our approach</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Automate Sweden is building a federated, multi-hub ecosystem where large enterprises connect with system integrators, hardware providers, startups, researchers and students. Here, companies can test, adapt and deploy advanced automation &mdash; including AI-based control systems, language-based interfaces and emerging humanoid platforms &mdash; in real production environments, and then standardize and scale validated solutions across sites using repeatable integration patterns.</p>

            <p>A shared "single front door", booking portal, and clear access rules make it easy for enterprises to engage without having to navigate a fragmented innovation landscape. Through shared testbeds, companies can validate applications, safety, and business value before moving forward with major investments. The cluster will secure clear governance for IP, data and confidentiality, enabling pre-competitive collaboration while protecting each partner's competitive differentiation.</p>

                <h2>Early adoption of humanoid robotics and foundation models</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The choice to include humanoid robotics and large language models early is strategic. Humanoids are intended, and in part built, to work in environments designed for humans, which reduces the need for costly rebuilding when flexibility is required. At the same time, breakthroughs in AI, such as vision-language-action models, simulation, and digital twins, enable robots to learn new tasks faster and operate in real environments. Several difficulties remain and alternative approaches exist, including within Swedish robot-related companies.</p>
