Automate Sweden is built as a **platform** and a **federated ecosystem**.  
These pillars describe the core building blocks that make the loop from needs to deployment work.

---

## 1) Industry needs and real use cases

The ecosystem is needs-driven.  
We start from real industrial challenges in SMEs and large enterprises — and translate them into concrete automation use cases that can be validated and deployed.

---

## 2) Shared testbeds and validation environments

Automation must be proven in realistic settings.  
Automate Sweden connects and develops test and demonstration environments that allow methods, software, and systems to be evaluated before deployment.

---

## 3) Deployment pathways through integrators and providers

Industrial automation scales when it becomes deployable.  
System integrators and technology providers are essential in translating validated results into solutions that can be installed, maintained, and improved over time.

---

## 4) Methods, tools, and scalable practices

Beyond individual pilots, the goal is repeatability.  
Automate Sweden supports shared approaches — methods, interfaces, best practices, and reusable components — that reduce fragmentation and lower adoption cost.

---

## 5) Skills and capability building

Automation is not only technology — it is capability.  
We support competence development across roles: operators, engineers, integrators, and researchers, enabling organisations to adopt and evolve automation over time.

---

## 6) Trust, safety, and compliance-by-design

Advanced automation must be safe, secure, and trustworthy.  
Automate Sweden integrates safety, security, and regulatory readiness early, so that deployment can scale responsibly.

---

## Under development — by design

The pillars above define the stable backbone.  
The concrete focus areas and activities are being shaped through ongoing discussions and workshops with the organisations that engage.
