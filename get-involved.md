Automate Sweden is being developed step by step.  
Engagement therefore happens in **two phases**: shaping the cluster now, and participating in its activities once it is established.

Both matter — but they serve different purposes.

---

## Engage now: shaping the cluster

During the development phase, engagement focuses on **dialogue and co-design**.

Current ways to engage include:
- **Direct discussions** with the Automate Sweden team  
- **Workshops and roundtables** with companies, integrators, and researchers  
- **Joint exploration of challenges and opportunities** in industrial automation  

This phase is particularly relevant if you want to:
- influence the focus areas of the cluster  
- help define meaningful use cases and test environments  
- contribute experience, constraints, and perspectives from real operations  

**How to start**
1. Email us at **automate-sweden@excellent.se**  
2. Tell us who you are (SME / LE / integrator / provider / research)  
3. Add 2–3 lines on what you would like to explore or shape  
4. We will suggest a short meeting and/or invite you to the next relevant workshop

## Engage next: participating in the cluster

Once Automate Sweden is formally established, additional engagement pathways will open.

These will include structured opportunities such as:
- participation in pilot and demonstration activities  
- access to shared testbeds and infrastructure  
- collaboration within thematic or sector-focused initiatives  
- long-term partnerships across industry, research, and technology providers  

These modes of engagement are being designed based on insights gathered during the current development phase.

## Why engage early?

Because the cluster is **federated and needs-driven**.  
Early engagement helps ensure that priorities, testbeds, and collaboration formats match real industrial constraints and opportunities — and that Automate Sweden becomes a platform that creates value in practice.
