                        <li><b>Time-to-scale</b>: move from pilot projects to multi-site rollout with repeatable integration patterns</li>
                        <li><b>De-risking</b>: validated reference architectures, safety cases, cybersecurity patterns and procurement templates</li>
                        <li><b>Strategic positioning</b>: influence interfaces, data/IP governance and the "foundation robotics software" layer that will shape industrial automation over the next decade</li>
                        <li><b>Access to talent</b>: a direct pipeline of students, researchers and targeted education aligned with new competence demands</li>
                        <li><b>Access to knowledge and networks in Sweden and Europe</b>: faster partnering, benchmarking and technology diffusion through a curated ecosystem</li>
                        <li><b>Newest technologies without big fees to overseas tech companies</b>: a vendor-neutral approach that reduces lock-in and strengthens long-term capability and sovereignty</li>
