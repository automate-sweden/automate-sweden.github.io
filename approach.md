The cluster brings together six universities (LTH, KTH, LiU, &Ouml;rebro, Chalmers, UU), IUC/SWIRA, RISE, and leading companies (ABB, Tetra Pak, AstraZeneca and others). We are establishing a federated "Automate Sweden Campus" with RISE as host, a common "single front door", common test beds, and a booking portal. International partners (e.g. MIRMI/TUM, DLR, KIT, DTI/Fraunhofer IPA) provide peer review and pace.
