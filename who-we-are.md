Automate Sweden is a **national, federated ecosystem** for industrial automation.

It brings together organisations across Sweden — including:
- SMEs and large enterprises
- system integrators and technology providers
- universities and research environments
- institutes and public-sector actors

Participants remain independent. What unites them is shared purpose and shared infrastructure: building practical, deployable automation capability for Sweden.

## A federated ecosystem

Automate Sweden is not a single organisation.  
It is a collaboration structure that connects existing strengths across regions, sectors, and institutions — and creates continuity beyond individual projects.

## Under development — and open to contributors

The cluster is currently being shaped through discussions and workshops with stakeholders.

If you want to contribute to the design of the cluster — by bringing needs, use cases, infrastructure, or expertise — we invite you to engage.

See the **Get involved** page for the current engagement process.
